This is a proof of concept of an app that would be a marketplace for Magic the Gathering(tm) cards.

It can add cards, delete cards, add users, remove users to and from the database.

Users can search for card listings within the database and add those cards to either their cart or watchlist. "Purchased" cards will be in the user's purchased list. 

This was a final project for a software design class.
